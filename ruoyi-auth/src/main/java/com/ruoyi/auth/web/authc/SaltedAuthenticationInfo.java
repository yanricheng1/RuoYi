/**
 * Interface representing account information that may use a salt when hashing credentials.  This interface
 * exists primarily to support environments that hash user credentials (e.g. passwords).
 * <p/>
 * Salts should typically be generated from a secure pseudo-random number generator so they are effectively
 * impossible to guess.  The salt value should be safely stored along side the account information to ensure
 * it is maintained along with the account's credentials.
 * <p/>
 * This interface exists as a way for Shiro to acquire that salt so it can correctly perform
 * {@link org.apache.shiro.authc.credential.CredentialsMatcher credentials matching} during login attempts.
 * See the {@link org.apache.shiro.authc.credential.HashedCredentialsMatcher HashedCredentialsMatcher} JavaDoc for
 * more information on hashing credentials with salts.
